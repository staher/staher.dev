# Tasks & Backlog

Short tracker for implementation work. Update as tasks complete or priorities change.

## Now / next
- For each task, capture any decision changes in `docs/design.md` (date + rationale).
- Decide theming approach (Tailwind tokens vs DaisyUI vs Radix) and plan dark mode implementation.
- Refine typography/colors and choose final fonts.
- Add real data sources (projects/contact/résumé link) and wire to UI.
- Create favicon + social preview placeholder; set basic meta defaults.
- Expand SEO defaults if needed (canonical URL, OG/Twitter defaults).

## Upcoming
- Responsive tuning and accessibility pass (focus states, contrast, reduced motion).

## Follow-ups
- Dark mode theme: introduce CSS variables for colors, add toggle, and honor prefers-color-scheme.
- Hosting selection + deploy (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel), add CI build, and generate sitemap/robots once domain is set.
- Optional content pipeline improvements (Markdown/MDX, CMS later if desired).
